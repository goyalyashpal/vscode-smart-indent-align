## About ##

**Smart Indent/Align** is a [VSCode] extension that adds smart indentation and alignment.

This is an unofficial spiritual successor to [j-zeppenfeld's Tab-Indent Space-Align] extension,
which — unfortunately — has been abandoned.

[VSCode]: <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode> "microsoft/vscode: Visual Studio Code"
[j-zeppenfeld's Tab-Indent Space-Align]: <https://github.com/j-zeppenfeld/tab-indent-space-align> "j-zeppenfeld/tab-indent-space-align: A Visual Studio Code extension for those who know the difference between indentation and alignment."
